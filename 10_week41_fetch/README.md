#### Card game "War"

Deploy: https://rickleck.github.io/lab-examples/10_week41_fetch/dist/

-   Using the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to generate a deck for the common card game "War". Click the help button in the game to read the rules. The name of the card game inspired a certain theme...

-   Since "War" is a game of chance, the next turn can be generated and preloaded (the card images) in the background, minimizing load times for the user. That means the console log is always 1 turn ahead of the interface.

-   Use url param [?dev=1](https://rickleck.github.io/lab-examples/10_week41_fetch/dist/?dev=1) to see a shorter version of the game with only 4 pre-defined cards in each stack instead of the usual random 26.
